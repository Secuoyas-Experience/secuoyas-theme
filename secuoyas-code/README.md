## VSC Marketplace

Just push on the intall button.

## Github Repo

Clone the repo

Copy (or symlink) the generated package directory into the VS Code extensions directory.

To copy the theme:

    cp -R 'secuoyas-theme/secuoyas-code' ~/.vscode/extensions/

To symlink:

    ln -s ~/your.path.to.clone.folder/secuoyas-theme/secuoyas-code ~/.vscode/extensions/secuoyas-code

Then reload or restart VS Code. The generated theme package should be in the list of installed extensions, and "Secuoyas code" will be available in the list of themes.

Secuoyas Code theme is loosely based on the [VS Code template](https://github.com/mjswensen/themer/tree/master/cli/packages/themer-vscode) for [themer](https://github.com/mjswensen/themer) and [citylights](http://citylights.xyz/) by yummygum
