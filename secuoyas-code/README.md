# Installation instructions

## VS Code

Copy (or symlink) the generated package directory into the VS Code extensions directory.

To copy the theme:

    cp -R 'secuoyas-theme/secuoyas-code' ~/.vscode/extensions/

To symlink:

    ln -s ~/your.path.to.clone.folder/secuoyas-theme/secuoyas-code ~/.vscode/extensions/magma-dark

Then reload or restart VS Code. The generated theme package should be in the list of installed extensions, and "Themer Dark" will be available in the list of themes.

Secuoyas Code theme is based on by the [VS Code template](https://github.com/mjswensen/themer/tree/master/cli/packages/themer-vscode) for [themer](https://github.com/mjswensen/themer) and citylights by yummygum
