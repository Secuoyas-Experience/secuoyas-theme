## VS Code

Copy (or symlink) the generated package directory into the VS Code extensions directory:

    cp -R 'VS Code/theme-themer-vscode' ~/.vscode/extensions/

Then reload or restart VS Code. The generated theme package should be in the list of installed extensions, and "Themer Dark" will be available in the list of themes.
